# parameterized_iris

FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS CODE IS A HOT MESS UNTIL I FIGURE THIS OUT PROPERLY

This is the data set through which I'm learning how to parameterized reports using quarto. 

Reports are successfully rendered!
to render the reports, open and run the Render file.

on to making them pretty with typst.

I am here: 
I can create a mockup on Typst
I can render paramaterized reports using render()

Next:
how do I use the mockup as my template in render? 

Following this: https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst-custom.html
and Create a Format
in Terminal, I said 'quarto create extension format
chose pdf
named it iris

I've determined the terminology for what I want is to create a 'Typst format'
