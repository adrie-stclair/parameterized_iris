# parameterized_iris

FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS CODE IS A HOT MESS UNTIL I FIGURE THIS OUT PROPERLY

This is the data set through which I'm learning how to parameterized reports using quarto. 

Reports are successfully rendered!
to render the reports, open and run the Render file.

on to making them pretty with typst.

I am here: 
I can create a mockup on Typst
I can render paramaterized reports using render()
I can create a template in Typst (conf.typ) and use it as an import in a main file (main.typ)

Next: 
how do I do this in R? 
  I have been able to render a simple document (main.qmd). but haven't yet been able to import the template and render that (main2.qmd)
how do I use the mockup as my template in render?
